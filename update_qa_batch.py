            'answer': "We install stairlifts on almost any staircase in Norfolk—straight, curved, indoor, or even outdoor. Most straight stairlifts go in within a day with zero mess or structural changes. You get a smooth, quiet ride, folding seat and footrest so the stairs stay usable for everyone else, and safety sensors that stop instantly if anything's in the way. Reclaim your whole house again.",

            'answer': "Your stairs shouldn't keep you from the bedroom or basement you love. We've installed hundreds of home stairlifts across Norfolk and can usually give you an exact price over the phone after just a few quick photos. Battery-powered so they work even during power outages, remote controls, and a seat that swivels so you step off safely at the top.",

Yes, they cost more than straight ones, but Norfolk families tell us it's worth every penny when Mom or Dad can finally sleep in their own bedroom again instead of on the couch.",

They fit in surprisingly small spaces (even inside a closet), run quietly, and look beautiful with glass or solid walls. Perfect for wheelchairs, groceries, or just making life easier as the years go by.",
